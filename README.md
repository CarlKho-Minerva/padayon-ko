**Edit @ aug 13 2024 9pm GMT+8**: I will continue working on this project for the coming government testing. Please [click here](https://github.com/CarlKho-Minerva/padayon-ko/tree/70c5b20280b6cac0e711e466f8ccacb9c8b96fa8) to use the code committed on the **AUG 13 5AM GMT+8** *(2 hours before the deadline)*.

This entry is prototyped in Notion given its popularity amongst students. I will be moving towards a dedicated frontend + DB infrastructure on GCP later. This will be then be piloted in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu, Philippines in the next few days.

Please view `.env.example` for the API keys needed for you to run the demo.
