# Facebook Token Error Resolution

If you encounter the following error:

```
Facebook post response: {'error': {'message': 'Error validating access token: Session has expired on Sunday, 04-Aug-24 12:00:00 PDT. The current time is Sunday, 11-Aug-24 07:13:51 PDT.', 'type': 'OAuthException', 'code': 190, 'error_subcode': 463, 'fbtrace_id': 'AmX5zbnYhEpe__mFqkAiDc-'}}
```

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Understand the error**: This error occurs because your Facebook access token has expired. Access tokens have a limited lifespan for security reasons.

2. **Go to the Facebook Developers site**: Open your web browser and navigate to [https://developers.facebook.com/](https://developers.facebook.com/).

3. **Log in**: Use your Facebook credentials to log in to the Developers site.

4. **Navigate to your app**: From the dashboard, select the app you're using for this project.

5. **Go to Tools & Support**: In the left sidebar, click on "Tools & Support".

6. **Select Graph API Explorer**: Under the Tools section, click on "Graph API Explorer".

7. **Generate a new token**:
   - Select your app from the dropdown menu at the top.
   - Click on "Generate Access Token".
   - You may need to grant necessary permissions.

8. **Copy the new token**: Once generated, copy the new access token.

9. **Update your code**: Replace the old token in your `config.py` file with the new one:

   ```python
   FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_new_token_here"
   ```

10. **Restart your application**: Run your script again with the new token.

Note: Facebook access tokens typically expire after about 60 days. Set a reminder to refresh your token regularly to avoid interruptions.

Remember to keep your access token secure and never share it publicly!
