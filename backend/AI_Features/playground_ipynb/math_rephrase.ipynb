    "Function calling makes it easier for you to get structured data outputs from generative models. You can then use these outputs to call other APIs and return the relevant response data to the model. In other words, function calling helps you connect generative models to external systems so that the generated content includes the most up-to-date and accurate information.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can provide Gemini models with descriptions of functions. These are functions that you write in the language of your app (that is, they're not Google Cloud Functions). The model may ask you to call a function and send back the result to help the model handle your query.\n",

    "Example API for lighting control\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a basic lighting control system with an application programming interface (API) and you want to allow users to control the lights through simple text requests. You can use the Function Calling feature to interpret lighting change requests from users and translate them into API calls to set the lighting values. This hypothetical lighting control system lets you control the brightness of the light and it's color temperature, defined as two separate parameters:\n",

    "colorTemperature \tstring \tyes \tColor temperature of the light fixture which can be daylight, cool or warm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, this imaginary lighting system only has one light, so the user does not have to specify a room or location. Here is an example JSON request you could send to the lighting control API to change the light level to 50% using the daylight color temperature:\n",

    "When you create a function to be used in a function call by the model, you should include as much detail as possible in the function and parameter descriptions. The generative model uses this information to determine which function to select and how to provide values for the parameters in the function call.\n",
    "Caution: For any production application, you should validate the data being passed to the API function from the model before executing the function.\n",

    "1. **`is_prime(n)` Function:**\n",
    "   - Takes an integer `n` as input.\n",
    "   - Returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1 (not prime).\n",
    "   - Iterates from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any\n",
    "     number in this range, it's not prime, and we return `False`.\n",
    "   - If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the number is prime, and\n",
    "     we return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`sum_of_primes(n)` Function:**\n",
    "   - Takes an integer `n` (number of primes desired) as input.\n",
    "   - Initializes an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers.\n",
    "   - Starts a loop, iterating through numbers starting from 2.\n",
    "   - For each number `i`, it checks if it's prime using the `is_prime()` function.\n",
    "   - If `i` is prime, it's appended to the `primes` list.\n",
    "   - The loop continues until the `primes` list has `n` prime numbers.\n",
    "   - Finally, it calculates and returns the sum of all the prime numbers in the\n",
    "     `primes` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Part:**\n",
    "   - Calls `sum_of_primes(50)` to get the sum of the first 50 prime numbers.\n",
    "   - Prints the result.\n",
